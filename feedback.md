The author suggests two methods:

-  <a href="mailto:asceticprogrammer@piccolboni.info">e-mail</a>;
-  Annotate the <a href="/book">online book</a>.


For comments that are closely related to the text of the book and, in particular, for reporting errors, the annotation method is recommended. Just head to the  <a href="/book">online book</a> and click the icons in the top right corner, or select some text (annotation icons will pop up). You will need a free account on <a href="http://hypothes.is">Hypothes.is</a>. Terms and conditions related to the annotations are those set by that organization, not the author of this book. Please consider this facility experimental for the time being.
