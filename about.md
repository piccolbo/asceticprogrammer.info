[Antonio Piccolboni](https://piccolboni.info) is a computer and data scientist. He holds a PhD in computer science from the University of Milan. His three decades career has spanned computer theory, computational biology, data analysis and software engineering. His main claims to fame are the NP-completeness proof for the ground state problem in a combinatorial model of protein folding (which he would have never pulled off without the help of his co-authors)[^1] and an R package for large scale data analysis, [rmr2](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/rmr2), which has been downloaded more than 2 million times, making some practitioners [very happy](https://groups.google.com/g/rhadoop/c/CUHaESXQJ2Y/m/fyQzMHRkfv0J).
